TextMate Bundle for FileMaker
Revision: 9/17/10

This is a paired down version of the FileMaker bundle
created by Chuck Ross. I've taken out all duplicate functions

Keyword shorthand versions of words

  record = rec
  number = num
  summary = sum
  timestamp = ts
  evaluate = eval
  object = ob
  value(s) = val
