# TextMate bundle for FileMaker Pro
## (Adapted for Sublime Text 2)

---
## Introduction

This is an adaptation of the TextMate Bundle for FileMaker Pro for use in Sublime Text 2.

Provides syntax highlighting and code snippets. Other functionality relating to commands are not available for Sublime Text.

This project was forked from a simpler version by Matt Petrowsky.  His bundle was a simplification of the original bundle by Charles Ross. My version mostly adds to the commands.

## Installation

### For easy installation

1. Download these files. (You can use the "Zip" button.)
1. Extract the .zip contents if necessary.
1. Change the name of the folder to "FileMaker.tmbundle". (You will have to remove some metadata from the name.)
1. Move the folder to ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages

### For easy upgrades

For easiest updates, use git. You can install git following these [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git). Install using these commands:

You can set up the bundle as a git repository right where TextMate installs it. Here are the Terminal commands:

	mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages
	cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages
	git clone -b SublimeText2 git://github.com/DonovanChan/filemaker.tmbundle.git
